The Odin Project - Sign-up Form

Sign-up page for an imaginary service called "Chapter & Verse" - an online book
club that recommends and suggests books based on your preferences and recently
read books.

The sign-up page includes the following main features:
- submission form with custom styling
- custom validation for password field, password confirmation input
- custom validation and masking for phone number input
- layout changes to single column view when viewport width is reduced

Known Issues:
- password verification message not aligned/showing correctly on page
- need to add checkmark and x-mark validation icons to fields
- adjust styling to start with neutral borders and only change to red when input
is interacted with by the user leaving the input in an invalid state
